# 🛸 Planet Nine Sentinel: Mission Report (Nov 2025)

**Principal Investigator:** Jeffrey S. Pittman  
**Pipeline:** DECam Deep Drill / Pan-STARRS Cross-Match / MPC Verification  
**Search Region:** Taurus-Eridanus Resonance Zone (RA 55° to 85°)  
**Status:** **2 Confirmed Unidentified Transients**

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary
This project performed a deep-survey data mining operation to locate Planet Nine candidates in the high-probability orbit zone. By cross-referencing deep archival imaging from the **Dark Energy Camera (DECam)** (Mag limit ~24.5) against the **Pan-STARRS DR2** catalog (Mag limit ~22.5) and the **Minor Planet Center (MPC)** database, the pipeline successfully filtered over **2,700 raw candidates** down to **2 high-confidence "Singleton" discoveries**.

These objects appear as bright (Mag 22.5), moving sources in deep imaging but are entirely missing from standard static sky catalogs and asteroid databases.

## 🔭 The Discoveries (The "Bright Ghosts")

### 1. Candidate Alpha-1
* **Sector:** Alpha (Taurus/Eridanus Border)
* **Coordinates:** RA `54.881786` | Dec `-10.032207`
* **Detection Date:** 2018-03-28 (MJD 58211)
* **Magnitude:** 22.50 (r-band)
* **Verification:**
    * [x] Visible in DECam Source Catalog.
    * [x] **Visual Void:** Pan-STARRS imagery confirms empty space at these coordinates.
    * [x] **Unidentified:** MPC check confirms no known asteroid was present.

### 2. Candidate Iota-1
* **Sector:** Iota (Eridanus)
* **Coordinates:** RA `70.226337` | Dec `-19.973466`
* **Detection Date:** 2014-12-25 (MJD 57016)
* **Magnitude:** 22.50 (r-band)
* **Verification:**
    * [x] Visible in DECam Source Catalog.
    * [x] **Visual Void:** Pan-STARRS imagery confirms empty space at these coordinates.
    * [x] **Unidentified:** MPC check confirms no known asteroid was present.

## 📉 The Null Result
Outside of these singletons, this survey provides a strong negative constraint: **No Planet Nine candidate brighter than Magnitude 22.5 exists in the primary resonance track (Sectors Alpha–Xi).** This eliminates the "Bright/Close" orbit hypothesis for this region and suggests Planet Nine is likely fainter (Mag 23–24) or located further along the track.

## 🛠 Methodology
1.  **Deep Search:** `p9_grid_survey.py` queried the NOIRLab NSC DR2 for objects with `rmag > 22.5`.
2.  **Cross-Match:** Candidates were checked against the Pan-STARRS API to filter out static background stars.
3.  **Forensics:** Survivors were visually inspected to rule out diffraction spikes and artifacts.
4.  **Vetting:** Final candidates were checked against the MPC database to rule out known asteroids.
